> Some Automator workflows for quickly translating between Hungarian and English on macOS

## Contents

This repo contains three workflows:

1. **EN-HU:** Opens a Google Translate popup that translates the selected text from English to Hungarian
2. **HU-EN:** Opens a Google Translate popup that translates the selected text from Hungarian to English
3. **Wiktionary:** Opens a popup with the Wiktionary entry for the selected word. This works for single words in any language.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo or [download it](https://github.com/localjo/hungarian-automator-workflows/archive/master.zip) and extract the files.
2. Right-click on the `.workflow` file(s) you want to install and then click "Open".
3. When asked if you are sure, click "Open" again.
4. When asked if you want to install, click "Install", or "Open with Automator" if you want to customize the workflow.

## Usage

Once these workflows have been installed, they can be used from the Services menu in apps that support them (such as a web browser) when you have selected some text in that app.

The Services menu can usually be found in three places:
  1. In the menu bar, as a sub-menu under the current app's name
  2. In the context menu, when you right-click on selected text
  3. In the touchbar, when you tap the `fn` key on your keyboard

Select some text, choose the workflow you want to run from the Services menu, and you should see a popup with the results.

## Feedback

I've been using these workflows for awhile on my own computer, but I haven't tried installing them on other computers. If you run into any issues, please leave feedback on GitHub.

Pull Requests welcome. Thanks!
